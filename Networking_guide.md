# Networking Basics

## 1. Introduction
Networking is a crucial part of modern technology, connecting computers and devices to share data and resources. Understanding the basics of networking is essential for anyone working in IT, as it forms the foundation for more advanced topics such
as network security, troubleshooting, and system administration.

## 2. What is a Network?
A network is a system of interconnected computers and end-devices that communicate with each other. The most common type is a Local Area Network (LAN), which connects devices within a limited area, such as an office or home. Wide Area Networks (WANs) extend over a larger 
area, connecting LANs across things such as cities. 

## 3. Basic Networking Components
- **Router**: Connects multiple networks and directs data traffic.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN and forwards data based on MAC addresses.
- **Modem**: Modulates and demodulates signals for internet access.
- **Network Cables**: Used for wired connections; common types include Ethernet (Cat5, Cat6).

## 4. IP Addresses
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, enabling communication. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit and written as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 addresses use 128-bit and are represented in hexadecimal
(e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

## 5. Subnets and Subnetting
Subnets allow network administrators to partition a network into smaller, more manageable sections. This helps improve performance and security by limiting broadcast domains. Subnetting involves calculating the network and host portions of an IP address to define subnets.

## 6. DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS, or Domain Name System, acts as the "phonebook" of the internet, converting domain names like www.example.com into IP addresses like 192.0.2.1, enabling browsers to locate and access websites.

## 7. Basic Networking Protocols
- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: The foundational protocol suite for internet communication.
- **HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure)**: Used for transferring data on the web.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: A standard network protocol for transferring files between a client and server.

## 8. Conclusion
Mastering the fundamentals of networking opens the door to more advanced studies and professional opportunities in IT. By understanding how data is transferred and managed, youâ€™ll be better equipped to tackle network troubleshooting and security challenges.
